I am currently a post-doctoral researcher at ETH ZÃ¼rich, supervised by Prof. Niao He, since the end of 2022. Prior to this role, I was a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania from 2019 to 2022, working under the guidance of Professors Alejandro Ribeiro and Hamed Hassani. I obtained his Bachelor's degree and Ph.D. in 2014 and 2019, respectively, from Zhejiang University, under the supervision of Prof. Hui Qian.

I am particularly intrigued by the connection between physics and machine learning, and my current research focuses on developing neural network-based methods for solving partial differential equations using entropy dissipation principles. I am also actively involved in optimization in the probability space and stochastic optimization techniques for addressing machine learning problems.
